@RequestBody is used to extract the HTTP request body
data, often in JSON or XML format, and deserialize it into a Java object. @RequestParam is used to extract individual parameter values from the request URL or submitted form data.

@PathVariable is a powerful annotation in Spring that allows you to make your controllers more dynamic and flexible by extracting values directly from the URI.
