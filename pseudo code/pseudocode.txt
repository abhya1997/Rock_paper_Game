START

Prompt user to enter the radius of the circle
Read radius from user input

 pie value = 3.14159

Calculate area of the circle:
area = PI * radius^2

Calculate circumference of the circle:
circumference = 2 * PI * radius

Display the calculated area

Algorithm
Algorithm: CalculateAreaOfCircle

Inputs: 
  radius (number) - The radius of the circle

Outputs:
  area (number) - The calculated area of the circle

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Read the value of radius from user

Step 3: Check if the radius is less than or equal to 0
        If true, display an error message "Invalid radius. Please enter a positive value."
        If false, continue to the next step

Step 4: Calculate the area of the circle using the formula:
        area = Ï€ * radius^2

Step 5: Display the calculated area of the circle

Step 6: End
